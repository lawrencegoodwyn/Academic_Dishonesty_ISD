# School District Analysis

## Analysis Purpose

    The purporse of this analysis was to identify if any potential cases of academic dishonesty had occured in the school at Thomas High School. By looking at the the grades of math and reading scores for all of the 15 schools in the district, a clearer picture of academic dishonesty can be painted; In addition to the school size, budget, and spending per capita, an analysis of the characteristics and grades earned can be made. Looking at the available metrics contained in the data,  an analysis was made to see if Thomas High School's occurence of academic dishonesty made any effect on the overall metrics of the school district body.

## Results

- The district originally had a reading passing percentage, math passing percentage, and overall passing percentage of: 75%, 86%, and 65%, respectively. When Thomas High School's 9th grade data is taken out of this data set, these percentages dropped to 74.8%, 85.7%, and 64.9%.  
- Once Thomas High School's 9th grade scores were omitted from the data set, there was a signifcant change in the grade outcomes. With, '% Percent Passing Math', '% Percent Passing Reading', and '% Percent Passing Overall', changing from 67%, 70%, and 65% to 93%, 97%, and 91%, respectively. 
- Suprisingly, removing Thomas High School's 9th grade data does not change its position relative to the District, it is the second highest ranked school in the district--despite the class' scores increasing the entire district's overall passing percentages. 
-When removing Thomas High School's 9th grade scores:
    - The 10th, 11th, and 12th grade scores remain unchanged.
    - Scores by school spending remain unchanged.
    - Scores by school size remains unchanged. 
    - Scores by school type remains unchnaged. 

## Summary 

    There was a definite change in the some of the metrics of the data upon removing Thomas High School's 9th grade scores from the dataset. Especially when it comes to the school district's overall percentages and Thomas High School's percentages for its passing math, reading, and overall percentages. This might be indicative of cheating, especially because it was able to shift the district's percentages, and such a dramatic shift for its own percentages. But, even before replacing the grades with NaNs, Thomas High School was still ranked 2nd best so this could have just been a good year for them.
